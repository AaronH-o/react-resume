          Hey, I’m Aaron 👋 I’m a fullstack developer based in San Francisco who
          loves building tools that feel simple, intuitive, and fun to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with languages like <strong> TypeScript, Python, and Java</strong>,
          and I’m comfortable across frameworks like <strong>React, Node.js, and Express</strong>.
          Whether it’s designing a playlist app with user authentication or creating
          a book search engine powered by GraphQL and MongoDB, I enjoy experimenting
          with new tech and making things that are both practical and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I’m motivated by clarity and accessibility — I like refining
          projects until they’re smooth, reliable, and easy for anyone to pick up. For me,
          development is about more than just writing code; it’s about crafting experiences
          that make everyday tasks a little better.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing badminton,
          exploring new cafes around the Bay Area, or traveling
          to discover fresh perspectives and inspiration. These hobbies keep me energized
          and remind me that creativity extends beyond the keyboard.
        </p>
